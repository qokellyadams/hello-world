Your name and the name of the variable and the value currently stored in it.</br>
</br></br></br>
Output should look like:</br>

  </br></br></br>
Your program must:</br>

When you are done, print your code out and put it in the tray then the teacher or an intern will take your paper and come around to check that your program runs correctly</p>
